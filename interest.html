        <p>During the summer of 2021, I decided to create the 18to25 podcast. 
			The podcast's goal was just a fun space for older teens and young adults to discuss different ideas and issues in the world. As well as discuss entertaining topics like sports, crypto, and dating, 
			but the only catch was you could only be on the show if you were between the ages of 18 to 25. </p>

        <p>During high school, I have always had an interest in video production. I always 
           wanted to know what was happening behind the scenes of large-scale productions. 
           That is why I attended Tulsa Technology school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Which is a trade school 
           in Oklahoma that allows high school students to learn different types of trades. Ranging from 
           electrical engineering, programming, piloting, and video production. Below is a skit that I did
           for are classes TV show every week on campus that was live-streamed all over the many Tulsa Tech campuses. </p>
