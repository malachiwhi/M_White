   <p>Coding has always been something I have been interested in, even before I came to school.
    I had always liked messing around with computers and seeing things' back-end/technical side.
    In 2019 I began to really learn how to code when I took my first HTML/CSS class, which I really enjoyed. 
    Then I moved on and started looking at more scripted languages like Python and C#. I also took a C Programming
    the course as well. On this page, I will be showing two projects that I have worked on during my time to become a programmer. </p>

      <p>Here I have one of my first C# projects which is a cardAPi, It allows you to store your cards 
        as well as delete them to. Which in programming is called a CRUD application where you Creat, Read,
        Update, and Delete data.
