        <p>My name is Malachi White. I am 21 years old, and I was born in Portland, Oregon, and was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I am a Junior studying Computer Information Systems at Florida A&M University. When I was younger, I played basketball all my life, my cousins played in the NBA, and I was good at basketball myself. So naturally, I wanted to go to the NBA; I ended up going to college in Louisiana for basketball. But after Covid-19, I walked away from the game and started my new path, coding!</p>
          <p>I started coding around two years ago, and I just fell in love with how everything had to work together. I loved the critical thinking aspect of using data structures and learning OOP and algorithms. It seemed as if ever since I started coding, I have become more intelligent because I see different ways coding and computers interact with the real world. I have been learning C#, Python, C, and C++ while using Angular and .NET Framework.</p>
          <p>The reason why I came to FAMU was for the excellent opportunity to be able to learn, network, and develop my skills as a future C# and Software Engineer.</p>
